# band-website-builder

Create a landing page for a band website with the following:

- Large hero section with an attention-grabbing photo of the band 
- Brief "About" section introducing the band members and musical style
- Mailing list signup form to get news and tour date announcements
- Links to the band's music on Spotify, Apple Music, etc
- Social media links to the band's profiles
- Footer with copyright info

Use a visually engaging, modern design with imagery and colors matching the band's genre and vibe. The band name is unknown, so use "The Band" as a placeholder for now.
